# 🔒 Canonical Proposal — Academic Time Architecture (Ifitwala_Ed)

## 0. Non-negotiable temporal invariant (lock this first)

**Academic Year (AY)**

* Default duration: **exactly one full academic cycle**
  → e.g. **01 Sep → 31 Aug**
* AY is a **hard outer boundary**
* **Nothing escapes it**:

  * Terms ⊂ AY
  * Breaks ⊂ AY
  * Calendars ⊂ AY
  * Attendance ⊂ AY
  * Enrollment ⊂ AY

This is *not just convention* — it enables:

* deterministic analytics
* clean rollover
* predictable archival
* accreditation alignment

You already model this correctly.

## 1️⃣ Should a School Calendar exist at a parent level (IIS)?

### **Answer: YES — but with a constrained semantic role**

This is where most systems get this wrong.
Here’s the correct distinction.

### ❌ What a parent-level calendar must **NOT** be

* Not the “real” instructional calendar for leaf schools
* Not something students or teachers operate against
* Not a place where term logic is inferred downward
* Not a source of automatic term instantiation

### ✅ What a parent-level calendar **IS**

A **baseline operational calendar** for:

* shared holidays
* statutory closures
* non-instructional institutional events
* region-wide constraints

Think:

* National holidays
* Ministry closures
* Accreditation blackout dates
* Org-wide PD days

### 🔐 Rule

> A **parent-school calendar is allowed**, but it is **non-instructional by default**.

### Concrete implications

* Parent calendar:

  * has **Academic Year**
  * has **holidays / breaks**
  * **must not auto-resolve instructional terms**
* Leaf calendars:

  * are **instructional**
  * may **overlay** parent calendar dates
  * never inherit terms implicitly

### Why this is future-proof

* Works for:

  * multi-country orgs
  * IB vs local programs
  * partial campus closures
* Avoids forcing leaf schools into identical pedagogical structures

✔ yes But only if we **downgrade its authority**

---

## 2️⃣ Allow “global terms” (school = null)?

### **Answer: YES — but strictly as templates (Option B)**

Global terms are dangerous *unless their role is explicit*.
This is where **Option B** is now locked.

### ❌ What global terms must NOT be

* Active instructional terms
* Automatically instantiated into schools
* Generators of School Events
* Counted in analytics without explicit resolution

### ✅ What global terms ARE (Option B)

> **Reusable, non-operational term templates scoped to an Academic Year**

Examples:

* “Semester 1 / Semester 2”
* “Trimester A / B / C”
* “Quarter 1–4”
* “IB Term Structure”

### 🔐 Rule (Option B — Canonical)

> A Term with `school = null` is a **template only**.
> It **never becomes active** unless resolved by a School Calendar.

### Activation semantics

Global terms may be:

* **resolved at runtime** (calendar, enrollment, analytics)
* **instantiated explicitly** (copy/create) with user confirmation

They must **never**:

* create School Events
* appear in instructional analytics
* silently populate child schools

✔ Global terms are allowed
❌ Global terms are never operational by default

---

## 3️⃣ Should School Calendars auto-populate terms?

### **Answer: YES — but only via explicit Option B resolution**

Auto-population is correct **only if deterministic, visible, and reversible**.

### Safe auto-population hierarchy (LOCKED)

When creating or validating a School Calendar:

1. **School-specific terms exist**
   → Auto-populate **those only**
2. **No school terms, but global templates exist**
   → Resolve via **Option B** (no mutation)
3. **Nothing exists**
   → Empty calendar + explicit warning

### 🔐 Hard rules

* Auto-population must:

  * be reviewable
  * be reversible
  * never create terms silently
* Resolution must:

  * record source (`school | template`)
  * never guess inheritance
* Only **school-scoped terms** may:

  * generate School Events
  * drive instructional counts

✔ Auto-population is correct
❌ Blind inheritance is forbidden

---

## 🧠 Final Unified Mental Model (Option B Explicit)

```
Academic Year (IIS)
│  └─ Hard temporal container
│
├── Global Term Templates (school = null)
│   └─ Non-operational, no events, no analytics
│
├── Parent School Calendar (IIS)
│   └─ Non-instructional baseline (holidays only)
│
├── School (ISS)
│   ├── Terms (ISS-specific)
│   └── School Calendar (ISS)
│       ├── Academic Year = IIS
│       ├── Terms = resolved via Option B
│       └── Overlays parent calendar
│
└── School (IPS)
    ├── Terms (IPS-specific)
    └── School Calendar (IPS)
```

## 🔒 Governance Rules (Updated)

1. Academic Year is the sole outer temporal boundary.
2. Terms are pedagogical and school-scoped **or templates**.
3. Global terms are templates, never active by default.
4. School Calendars resolve terms explicitly (Option B).
5. Parent calendars are allowed but non-instructional.
6. Auto-population is allowed; silent inheritance is forbidden.
7. Only school-scoped terms may generate School Events.

# 📘 `academic_time_governance.md`

> **Status:** LOCKED (v1.1 — Option B)
> **Scope:** Academic Year, Term, School Calendar
> **Authority:** This document governs all academic-time behavior in Ifitwala_Ed.
> Any implementation (Desk, SPA, API, reports, analytics) **must conform**.

---

## 1. Core Intent

Ifitwala_Ed models academic time using **explicit resolution**, not inheritance.

**Option B is canonical**:

> Terms are resolved by context, never auto-instantiated.

The system must support:

* multi-campus institutions
* divergent term structures
* shared closures and constraints
* deterministic analytics
* safe future extensions (accreditation, cross-school reporting)

---

## 2. Canonical Objects and Roles

### 2.1 Academic Year (AY)

*(unchanged, reaffirmed)*

* Hard temporal container
* Outer boundary
* No downward inference

---

### 2.2 Term

**Rules (clarified)**

* Every Term belongs to:

  * exactly one Academic Year
  * either:

    * one School (active term)
    * no school (template)

#### Global Terms (Option B)

* `school = null`
* Templates only
* Never:

  * create events
  * appear in analytics
  * auto-populate schools
* Only resolved via School Calendar

---

### 2.3 School Calendar (Canonical, Option B)

> A School Calendar represents the **resolved operational calendar**
> for one school in one academic year.

**Rules**

* Always school-scoped
* Always AY-scoped
* Resolves terms via:

  * school terms first
  * global templates second
* Never mutates term data implicitly

---

### 2.4 Parent-Level School Calendars

*(clarified)*

* Allowed
* Non-instructional
* Holiday-only
* Never resolve instructional terms

---

## 3. Term Resolution Rules (Option B)

Resolution is **read-only** and **deterministic**.

1. School-specific terms
2. Global templates
3. Nothing → empty calendar

**Silent inheritance is forbidden.**

---

## 4. Analytics & Reporting (Option B Safe)

* Analytics operate only on:

  * resolved school terms
* Templates excluded unless resolved
* Parent calendars affect:

  * blackout windows
  * holiday overlays only

---

## 5. Invariants (Expanded)

1. Academic Year is the sole outer boundary
2. Templates are never operational
3. Calendars resolve, not inherit
4. Events come only from school terms
5. Automation must be explicit and reversible

---

## 🧰 Helper (Canonical)

### `resolve_terms_for_school_calendar(school, academic_year)`

**Status:** Canonical (Option B)

* Read-only
* Deterministic
* No mutation
* Used by:

  * School Calendar
  * Enrollment
  * Attendance
  * Analytics

---

## 🔚 Final Position (Locked)

You now have:

* Explicit Option B semantics
* Clean separation of template vs operational data
* Zero inheritance magic
* Analytics-safe resolution
* A framework that scales across jurisdictions and pedagogy

Pattern B — Canonical School Calendar Resolution (Authoritative Design)
Ifitwala_Ed adopts Pattern B for school calendar modeling. A School Calendar is always a school-scoped execution artifact, but it does not need to exist at every leaf school. Calendars may be defined at any school node (leaf or non-leaf). Leaf schools must explicitly resolve to a calendar via a deterministic ancestor lookup, never by implicit inheritance. The resolution order is: (1) calendar defined for the leaf school and academic year; (2) calendar defined for the nearest ancestor school for the same academic year; (3) configuration error if none exists. No calendar is auto-created, inferred, or silently inherited. All downstream systems (terms, events, attendance, analytics) must resolve calendars exclusively through this canonical resolver.


When a leaf school needs a calendar for AY:

1. If a calendar exists for (leaf, AY) → use it
2. Else if a calendar exists for (nearest ancestor, AY) → use it
3. Else → configuration error








---

## ✅ Correct usage pattern (locked)

From now on, all code must follow this rule:

### Rule 1 — Visibility & hierarchy

Use **only** `school_tree.py`:

* `get_descendant_schools`
* `get_ancestor_schools`
* `is_leaf_school`
* `get_user_default_school`
* `get_effective_record` (when allowed)
* `get_first_ancestor_with_doc`

### Rule 2 — Instructional resolution

Use **only explicit resolvers**, e.g.:

* `resolve_terms_for_school_calendar`
* `resolve_school_calendars_for_window` (implemented in `school_settings_utils.py`)
* `resolve_school_calendar_for_attendance` (future)
* `resolve_school_calendar_for_enrollment` (future)

Never mix the two.

---

## Concrete impact on what we just reviewed

### `SchoolCalendar` permission logic

➡ **Must** use:

```python
from ifitwala_ed.utilities.school_tree import get_descendant_schools, is_leaf_school
```

and **never** call `get_ancestors_of` / `get_descendants_of` directly.

### `get_permission_query_conditions`

➡ Must delegate hierarchy to `school_tree.py`.

### `has_permission`

➡ Same.

### `get_events`

➡ Visibility via `school_tree.py`,
➡ Calendar resolution via **explicit calendar lookup**, not hierarchy guessing.

---

## Design lock (this is now official)

You can add this as a hard rule to your governance docs:

> **All school hierarchy traversal and visibility decisions MUST go through `school_tree.py`.
> Direct use of `frappe.utils.nestedset` outside this module is forbidden.**

This aligns perfectly with:

* Pattern B
* Your caching strategy
* Your permission semantics
* Your analytics expectations
